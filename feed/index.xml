<p>Win.</p>



<p>A question to be asked &#8211; <strong>Win against who?</strong></p>



<p>Useless to win <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_science" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">against other people.</a></p>



<p>Useful to win over one&#8217;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">own mind.</a></p>



<p>But real winning lies, in fighting face-to-face with God.</p>



<p><strong>The creator.</strong></p>



<p>The only thing we know about creator, is his creation.</p>



<p>The nature.</p>



<p>It can be exploited.</p>



<p>It can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ESXOAJRdcwQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hacked.</a></p>



<p>Truth can be seen.</p>



<p>Immortality can be<strong> </strong><a href="https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved.</a></p>



<p>God can be uncovered.</p>



<p><strong>Physics can be <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_everything" target="_blank">completed.</a></strong></p>



<p>Win over <strong>nature</strong>.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what is needed.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m tired of being a nihilist. It&#8217;s pathetic, to waste time.</p>



<p>So, here&#8217;s the objective purpose.</p>



<p>For all you nihilists.</p>



<p><strong>Win.</strong></p>

<p>

The universe is probably the way it is, having no personal relation to  the tiny dot called earth and to this carbon based life that live here. This big onion, the universe, having, millions and millions of layers to be unwrapped and solved is crazy. 

</p>



<p>The creation of this universe, however sadly, will remain mystery. It&#8217;s a paradox. If it was created, who created the creator. Nothing comes out of nothing, ultimately. But universe is here, we know it. And we can&#8217;t have the ultimate answers.</p>



<p>It is really easy now to accept the fact that we cannot know the answers to big questions of the universe or ultimate existence in our lifetime and not even after dying, as we probably cease to exist at all after it. The creation will forever remain the paradox..</p>



<p>I and a lot of us who dealt with these questions have accepted this fact, so that we can look for the positive part of our life and live it the best way we can. </p>



<p>Knowing that, we are just stuck for some years on this tiny planet, we can&#8217;t know the ultimate answers. But we can use the time we are here. We define how we use it. We spend it for the people we care about. We spend it for ourselves. We spend it for joy, happiness and craziness. Some in the history has spent it to solve the same questions. We can spend it to get to know more and more about this crazy or scary universe. We can do whatever we want, however we want.</p>



<p>But sometimes, out of sudden thoughts, there&#8217;s a thought of not knowing, that we sometimes fear.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s controllable,  and we can live with that. Not everyone, as these questions are also sometimes cause for depression, anxiety, laziness to lot of people. We call it Existential Crisis. And the possible answers aren&#8217;t comforting too. But the possible answers give us no reason to not live. Why not live? Why not do crazy things? Why not laugh? Why not cry?</p>



<p>For me it was easier to accept the defeat. Universe is evil and won, i showed the middle finger in return.  </p>



<p>But as the time passes, as we run out of time, the questions will come back to haunt our sleep. There are times when the questions suddenly scare us again. When we are out of distractions.</p>



<p>When you will have done everything in your life, the questions will still be there, left unsolved, laughing at you. The fear of disappearing forever without knowing anything about the origin of the damn universe. That&#8217;s how it looks like.</p>



<p class="has-secondary-background-color has-background has-small-font-size">There are hopes however like extraterrestrial life or theory of everything, that will cut out some possible answers, taking us near to the ultimate answers, but the more we know, more crazy it becomes.</p>
